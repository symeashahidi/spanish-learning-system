# WordCards Language Learning Database

A web application with a MySQL database backend, designed to manage data for a Spanish language learning system. It features CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions to facilitate the input, modification, and removal of vocabulary words, their definitions, and example sentences. Users can then utilize these vocabulary words to create practice lists.
